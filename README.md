# Facial-expression-recognition-with-keras
This project is a part of Coursera's Guided Project - Facial Expression Recognition with Keras

In this project, I have built and trained a CNN model in Keras to recognize the facial expressions. The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The objective is to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories {0:Angry, 1:Disgust, 2:Fear, 3:Happy, 4:Sad, 5:Surprise, 6:Neutral}. I have used OpenCV to automatically detect faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them.
